A Phaser 3 fishing game featuring a two-stage skill-based catching system: hook timing and DDR-style rhythm minigame. Catch fish, upgrade your equipment, and progress through day/night cycles!

---

## 🎣 How to Play

### Fishing Mechanics

1. **Click anywhere** to start from the title screen
2. **Click again** to cast your bobber into the water
3. The bobber automatically sinks and returns
4. When the bobber touches a fish, **Stage 1: Hook Timing** begins

### Stage 1: Hook Timing (Bar Minigame)

- A popup appears with a timing bar
- A red marker moves back and forth across the bar
- **Click** when the marker is in the **green success zone** (center)
- ✅ **Success**: Proceeds to Stage 2 (Rhythm Minigame)
- ❌ **Failure**: Fish escapes, bobber returns to dock

### Stage 2: Rhythm Minigame (DDR Style)

- Right half of screen shows 4 lanes with falling arrows
- Arrows fall Features

### Core Fishing Mechanics

- ✅ **Start Scene**: Title screen with click to start
- ✅ **Dock Scene**: Player on dock with animated fisherman
- ✅ **Fisherman Animations**: Idle, fishing, and hooking sprites
- ✅ **Click to Cast**: Cast bobber with mouse click
- ✅ **Auto-Return**: Bobber automatically sinks and returns
- ✅ **Collision Detection**: Bobber triggers minigames on fish contact
- ✅ **Score System**: Points based on fish type and rarity

### Two-Stage Catching System

- ✅ **Hook Timing Minigame**:
  - Popup with moving marker on timing bar
  - Click when marker is in green zone
  - Success proceeds to rhythm game
  - Failure causes fish to escape
  - Marker speed scales with fish speed (faster fish = harder timing)
- ✅ **Rhythm Minigame (DDR Style)**:
  - Right half screen layout
  - 4 lanes with falling arrows
  - Arrow Keys (←, ↑, ↓, →) or WASD controls
  - Number of arrows based on fish health
  - 7-second timer with -0.5s penalties
  - Visual feedback for hits/misses
  - Success counter shows progress
  - Win = catch fish, Lose = fish escapesoints
- Trash items: 0 points

### Day/Night Cycle

- Each day = 15 casts
- ✅ **15 Casts Per Day**: Evenly distributed across times
- ✅ **Four Times of Day**:
  - Morning (0-3 casts): Light blue sky
  - Afternoon (4-7 casts): Bright blue sky
  - Evening (8-11 casts): Orange/pink sky
  - Night (12-14 casts): Dark purple sky
- ✅ **Dynamic Sky Colors**: Real-time color transitions
- ✅ **UI Display**: Shows "Day X - Time" and "Casts: X/15"
- ✅ **Auto Market Transition**: After 15 casts, goes to market to start new day
- ✅ **Market Scene**: Accessible via button or auto-transition after 15 casts
- ✅ **4 Shops**: Bait Shop, Line Shop, Rod Shop, Fish Buyer
- ✅ **Money System**: 1 fish point = $1 in cash
- ✅ **Auto Fish Sale**: Fish automatically sold when entering market
- ✅ **Three Upgrade Types**:
  - **Line Strength**: +2s rhythm timer per level (max 10 levels)
  - **Bait Quality**: +5% rare fish chance per level (max 10 levels)
  - **Rod Power**: +0.25x size multiplier per level (max 3 levels)
- ✅ **Progressive Costs**: Base price × 1.5^level
- ✅ **Persistent Data**: Money and upgrades saved in registry

- ✅ **Collision Detection**: Bobber catches fish on contact
- ✅ **Score System**: Points awarded based on fish type
  **Game Size**: 300x180 base (scales to 50% of window)
- **Engine**: Phaser 3 with Arcade Physics
- **Input**: Mouse click + Arrow Keys/WASD
- **Scenes**: Start → Dock → Minigame ⟷ Market
- **Assets**:
  - Fisherman sprite animations (idle, fish, hook)
  - 30+ unique fish sprites
  - Arrow images for rhythm minigame
  - Environment objects
- **Data Persistence**: Phaser Registry for score, money, upgradeeir movement direction

  - 15% chance for trash
  - 2% chance for legendary fish
  - 8% chance for rare fish
  - Rest are common/medium fish
- ✅ **Dynamic Population**: 3-12 fish at any time
- ✅ **Auto Spawning**: New fish appear every 2-5 seconds
- ✅ **Auto Despawning**: Fish disappear every 3-7 seconds (from edges)
- ✅ **Unique Behaviors**: Each fish type has different speed, size, points, and visual appearance

### Day/Night Cycle System

- ✅ **Cast Counter**: Tracks number of casts made
- ✅ **Day Progression**: Every 10 casts = 1 day
- ✅ **Times of Day**: Morning (0-2 casts), Afternoon (3-4), Evening (5-7), Night (8-10)

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### **PHASE 1: Expand Fish System & Balance** ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Add more fish variety, adjust scoring, and add trash items

**Completed Tasks**:

1. ✅ Reviewed and rebalanced existing fish scores/stats
2. ✅ Added 4 new fish types (Perch, Pike, Walleye, Sturgeon)
3. ✅ Added "trash" category items (boot, tin can, seaweed, plastic bag)
4. ✅ Trash items give 0 points
5. ✅ Updated fish spawn logic to include trash items
6. ✅ Set trash spawn rate at 15% chance
7. ✅ Visual distinction for trash (different colors)
8. ✅ Console messages for trash/legendary/rare catches

**Part 1: Initial Hook (Timing Bar)**

- When bobber touches fish, game pauses and timing bar appears
- Bar marker moves left-to-right across the bar
- Center zone is the "success zone"
- Player presses SPACE to attempt hook
- **Success**: Marker in center → Proceeds to arrow mini-game
- **Failure**: Marker outside center → Fish escapes, return to fishing

**Part 2: Arrow Rhythm Game** (Only if hook succeeds)

- 4 lanes at top of screen (Left, Down, Up, Right arrows)
- Arrows fall from top, player must press correct key when arrow reaches bottom
- Each successful hit reduces fish health by 1
- Timer counts down (10 seconds for basic bobber, varies by bait type later)
- **Success**: Fish health reaches 0 before timer expires → Catch the fish
- **Failure**: Timer reaches 0 before health depletes → Fish escapes
